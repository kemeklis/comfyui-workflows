Lower CFG gives you more creative but often blurrier results. Higher CFG (recommended max 10) gives you stricter results according to the CLIP prompt. If the CFG value is too high, it can also result in \"burn-in\" where the edges of the picture become even stronger, often highlighting details in unnatural ways.\n - sampler_name = This is the sampler type, and unfortunately different samplers and schedulers have better results with fewer steps, while others have better success with higher steps.

The first KSampler usually starts with Step 0. Starting at step 0 is the same as setting denoise to 1.0 in the regular Sampler node.\n - end_at_step = This is the step number the KSampler will stop it's process of de-noising the picture. If there is any remaining leftover noise and return_with_leftover_noise is enabled, then it will pass on the left over noise to the next KSampler (assuming there is another one)."],"color":"#223","bgcolor":"#335"},{"id":41,"type":"Note","pos":[2160.77001953125,229.60000610351562],"size":[320,120],"flags":{},"order":5,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[],"title":"Note - VAE Decoder","properties":{"text":"","widget_ue_connectable":{}},"widgets_values":["This node will take the latent data from the KSampler and, using the VAE, it will decode it into visible data\n\nVAE = Latent --> Visible\n\nThis can then be sent to the Save Image node to be saved as a PNG."],"color":"#332922","bgcolor":"#593930"},{"id":43,"type":"Note","pos":[1125,70],"size":[240,88],"flags":{},"order":6,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[],"title":"Note - CLIP Encode (REFINER)","properties":{"text":"","widget_ue_connectable":{}},"widgets_values":["These nodes receive the text from the prompt and use the optimal CLIP settings for the specified checkpoint model (in this case: SDXL Refiner)"],"color":"#323","bgcolor":"#535"},{"id":6,"type":"CLIPTextEncode","pos":[599.5,269.4800109863281],"size":[210,88],"flags":{},"order":19,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"clip","name":"clip","type":"CLIP","link":3},{"localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"text"},"link":16}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"CONDITIONING","name":"CONDITIONING","type":"CONDITIONING","slot_index":0,"links":[11]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.29","Node name for S&R":"CLIPTextEncode","widget_ue_connectable":{"text":true}},"widgets_values":["A cinematic, futuristic scene suitable for animation, depicting a dark-themed workspace.
